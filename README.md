# Tool-Tracker
Tool Tracker is a lightweight, zero-backend web app for managing tool check-ins and check-outs. It runs entirely in your browser using localStorage, making it perfect for small teams, workshops, or job sites that need to keep track of who has what; without setting up a database or server.
